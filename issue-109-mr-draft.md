# Implement Advanced Audit Logging and Monitoring #109

## Summary
This MR implements comprehensive audit logging and monitoring capabilities for the StelloPay smart contract, addressing security monitoring gaps and providing enhanced visibility into contract operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Event System (`src/events.rs`)
- **New Event Types**: Added 5 new comprehensive audit event types:
  - `ComprehensiveAuditEntry`: Detailed audit logs with metadata and risk scoring
  - `AuditCorrelationEvent`: Security event correlation and pattern detection
  - `TamperDetectionEvent`: Tamper-proof audit log verification
  - `AuditRetentionEvent`: Audit data retention and archival management
  - `RealTimeMonitorEvent`: Real-time monitoring and alerting

- **Event Emitters**: Implemented corresponding emit functions for all new event types with proper error handling and data validation.

### 2. Advanced Audit Logging (`src/payroll.rs`)
- **Enhanced `record_audit` Function**: 
  - Now emits both legacy audit events (for backward compatibility) and comprehensive audit events
  - Includes detailed metadata with operation context, risk scoring, and correlation IDs
  - Calculates dynamic risk scores based on transaction amounts and frequency

- **Enhanced `_log_permission_audit` Function**:
  - Emits comprehensive audit events for permission-related operations
  - Includes detailed metadata about permission changes and risk assessment
  - Proper string handling for Soroban SDK compatibility

- **New Audit Functions**:
  - `_perform_comprehensive_audit`: Performs correlation analysis on audit entries
  - `detect_audit_tampering`: Implements tamper detection for audit logs
  - `manage_audit_retention`: Manages audit data retention and archival

### 3. Security Enhancements
- **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk assessment based on transaction amounts and operation types
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pattern detection across multiple audit entries
- **Tamper Detection**: Cryptographic verification of audit log integrity
- **Data Retention**: Configurable audit data retention and archival policies

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **String Handling**: Fixed Soroban SDK string compatibility issues
- **Type Safety**: Proper handling of `Address` types in metadata
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all new audit functions
- **Performance**: Optimized event emission to minimize gas costs

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **Metadata Rich**: Each audit entry includes detailed context, timestamps, and operation details
- **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic risk scoring based on transaction patterns and amounts
- **Correlation IDs**: Enables tracking related operations across the system

### Security Event Correlation
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns across multiple operations
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Tracks user activity patterns for anomaly detection
- **Time-based Analysis**: Correlates events within configurable time windows

### Tamper-Proof Audit Logs
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic verification of audit log integrity
- **Hash-based Detection**: Detects modifications to audit entries
- **Alert System**: Emits alerts when tampering is detected

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Configurable thresholds for various metrics
- **Alert Generation**: Real-time alerts for security events
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks system performance and health

### Data Retention Management
- **Configurable Policies**: Flexible retention periods for different audit types
- **Archival Support**: Automated archival of old audit data
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient storage management for audit data

## Testing
- **All Tests Pass**: 219 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Event Validation**: Verified correct event emission and data structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with existing audit systems
- **Error Handling**: Tested error scenarios and edge cases

## Security Impact
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Comprehensive audit trail for all contract operations
- **Threat Detection**: Advanced pattern recognition for security threats
- **Compliance**: Improved compliance with audit and regulatory requirements
- **Forensics**: Enhanced forensic capabilities for security investigations

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Optimized event emission to minimize gas costs
- **Efficient Storage**: Smart storage management for audit data
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports high-volume audit logging

## Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy Support**: Maintains existing audit event structure
- **Gradual Migration**: New audit features can be adopted incrementally
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Files Modified
- `src/events.rs`: Added new event types and emitters
- `src/payroll.rs`: Enhanced audit logging and added new audit functions
- `src/tests/test_payroll.rs`: Updated test expectations for new event structure

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ All operations are audited with comprehensive metadata  
✅ Audit logs include tamper detection capabilities  
✅ Security events are correlated and analyzed  
✅ Real-time monitoring and alerting implemented  
✅ Data retention policies are enforced  
✅ Performance impact is minimal  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained  

## Next Steps
