# Employee Lifecycle Management Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented comprehensive employee lifecycle management for the Stello Pay contract, including onboarding and offboarding workflows, employee status management, and compliance tracking.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Events Module (`src/events.rs`)
Added new event types for employee lifecycle management:

#### Event Constants
- `EMPLOYEE_ONBOARDED` - Employee successfully onboarded
- `EMPLOYEE_OFFBOARDED` - Employee offboarded/terminated
- `EMPLOYEE_TRANSFERRED` - Employee transferred between departments
- `EMPLOYEE_STATUS_CHANGED` - Employee status updated
- `ONBOARDING_STARTED` - Onboarding workflow initiated
- `ONBOARDING_COMPLETED` - Onboarding workflow completed
- `OFFBOARDING_STARTED` - Offboarding workflow initiated
- `OFFBOARDING_COMPLETED` - Offboarding workflow completed
- `FINAL_PAYMENT_PROCESSED` - Final payment processed during offboarding
- `COMPLIANCE_UPDATED` - Compliance record updated
- `WORKFLOW_APPROVED` - Workflow step approved
- `TASK_COMPLETED` - Individual task completed

#### Event Structures
- `EmployeeOnboarded` - Contains employee, employer, department, job title, and hire date
- `EmployeeOffboarded` - Contains termination details and final payment info
- `EmployeeTransferred` - Contains department transfer details
- `EmployeeStatusChanged` - Contains old and new status information
- `OnboardingWorkflowEvent` - Contains workflow progress information
- `OffboardingWorkflowEvent` - Contains offboarding progress information
- `FinalPaymentProcessed` - Contains payment details including severance and leave
- `ComplianceUpdated` - Contains compliance status and dates
- `WorkflowApproved` - Contains approval details and comments
- `TaskCompleted` - Contains task completion information

#### Event Emission Functions
All events have corresponding emission functions that properly format and publish events to the blockchain.

### 2. Enterprise Module (`src/enterprise.rs`)
Implemented the `HRWorkflowManager` with comprehensive lifecycle management functions:

#### Core Functions

##### Onboarding Management
- `create_onboarding_workflow()` - Creates new employee onboarding workflow with default tasks
- `complete_onboarding_task()` - Marks individual onboarding tasks as completed
- Automatic status progression from Pending to Active when all required tasks are completed

##### Offboarding Management
- `create_offboarding_workflow()` - Creates employee offboarding workflow
- `process_final_payment()` - Handles final payment processing including severance and unused leave
- Automatic status change to Terminated

##### Employee Transfer
- `transfer_employee()` - Handles employee transfers between departments
- Updates employee profile with new department and manager
- Tracks transfer history and approval

##### Compliance Tracking
- `update_compliance()` - Updates employee compliance records
- Supports different compliance types and statuses
- Tracks due dates and completion dates

##### Workflow Approval
- `approve_workflow()` - Handles workflow step approvals
- Supports both onboarding and offboarding workflows
- Records approver comments and timestamps

### 3. Storage Integration
The implementation leverages the existing `LifecycleStorage` helper in `storage.rs` which provides:

#### Employee Profile Management
- `EmployeeProfile` structure with comprehensive employee information
- Status tracking (Pending, Active, Inactive, Terminated, OnLeave, Suspended)
- Department and manager assignments
- Hire and termination dates

#### Workflow Management
- `OnboardingWorkflow` and `OffboardingWorkflow` structures
- Task checklists with completion tracking
- Approval chains and status management
- Expiration dates and timestamps

#### Task Management
- `OnboardingTask` and `OffboardingTask` structures
- Required vs optional task designation
- Due date tracking and completion status
- Assignee and completion timestamp tracking

#### Compliance Management
- `ComplianceRecord` structure for tracking various compliance requirements
- Status tracking (Pending, Completed, Overdue, NotRequired)
- Due date and completion date management

### 4. Default Workflows

#### Onboarding Checklist
1. **Complete employment forms** (Required, 7 days)
   - Fill out all required employment documentation
2. **Setup payroll information** (Required, 3 days)
   - Configure salary and payment details
3. **Department orientation** (Required, 14 days)
   - Complete department-specific orientation

#### Offboarding Checklist
1. **Return company assets** (Required, 7 days)
   - Return all company property and equipment
2. **Complete exit interview** (Optional, 14 days)
   - Participate in exit interview process
3. **Process final payment** (Required, 30 days)
   - Calculate and process final compensation

## Integration Points

### Storage Keys
The implementation uses clever storage key management to work within Soroban's constraints:
- Employee profiles use existing `Employee` keys
- Onboarding workflows use offset Template keys (1000000+)
- Offboarding workflows use offset Preset keys (2000000+)
- Transfers use offset Backup keys (3000000+)
- Compliance records use AuditTrail keys

### Event Integration
All lifecycle events are properly integrated with the existing event system and can be monitored by external systems for:
- HR system integration
- Compliance reporting
- Audit trails
- Automated notifications

## Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with specific error types:
- `EmployeeNotFound`
- `InvalidEmployeeStatus`
- `OnboardingWorkflowNotFound`
- `OffboardingWorkflowNotFound`
- `TaskNotFound`
- `TaskAlreadyCompleted`
- `WorkflowExpired`
- `InvalidTransferRequest`
- `ComplianceRecordNotFound`
- `InvalidComplianceStatus`

## Next Steps

### Integration with Main Contract
To fully activate these features, the main contract interface needs to be updated to expose these functions as public contract methods.

### Testing
Comprehensive unit and integration tests should be added to verify:
- Workflow creation and progression
- Task completion and status updates
- Event emission
- Error handling
- Storage operations

### Documentation
Additional documentation should be created for:
- API reference for each function
- Workflow configuration guides
- Integration examples
- Best practices

## Benefits

### For Employers
- Automated onboarding and offboarding processes
- Compliance tracking and reporting
- Audit trails for all employee lifecycle events
- Standardized workflows with customizable tasks

### For Employees
- Clear visibility into onboarding progress
- Structured offboarding process
- Transparent status tracking
- Proper final payment processing

### For the System
- Comprehensive event logging
- Scalable workflow management
- Flexible compliance tracking
- Integration-ready architecture

The implementation provides a solid foundation for comprehensive employee lifecycle management while maintaining compatibility with the existing Stello Pay infrastructure.
