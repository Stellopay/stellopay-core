### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Data Structures
```rust
// Department management
pub struct Department {
    pub id: u64,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub employer: Address,
    pub manager: Address,
    pub parent_department: Option<u64>,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
    pub is_active: bool,
}

// Approval workflows
pub struct ApprovalWorkflow {
    pub id: u64,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub employer: Address,
    pub steps: Vec<ApprovalStep>,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
    pub is_active: bool,
}

// Webhook endpoints
pub struct WebhookEndpoint {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub url: String,
    pub employer: Address,
    pub events: Vec<String>,
    pub headers: Map<String, String>,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub last_triggered: Option<u64>,
}
```

#### Key Functions
- `create_department()` - Create new organizational departments
- `assign_employee_to_department()` - Assign employees to departments
- `create_approval_workflow()` - Set up multi-step approval processes
- `create_webhook_endpoint()` - Configure external integrations
- `create_report_template()` - Define custom report configurations
- `create_backup_schedule()` - Set up automated backup schedules

### 🧪 Testing
